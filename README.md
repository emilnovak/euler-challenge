# euler-challenge

For the next 30 days starting from 2019.03.04. I will solve a challenge from https://projecteuler.net to practice coding. These challenges seemingly start off easy so my goal is to improve myself by staying consistent and doing a challenge every day. I am a fairly competitive person, so I challenge you the reader to take part as well! I am using python3 but feel free to use any language. The tasks could often be further optimized, but the baseline is to solve one every day.
